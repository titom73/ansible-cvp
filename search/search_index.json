Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features. Reporting Bugs # First, ensure that you\u2019ve installed the latest stable version of ansible-cvp . If you\u2019re running an older version, it\u2019s possible that the bug has already been fixed. Next, check the GitHub issues list to see if the bug you\u2019ve found has already been reported. If you think you may be experiencing a reported issue that hasn\u2019t already been resolved, please click \u201cadd a reaction\u201d in the top right corner of the issue and add a thumbs up (+1). You might also want to add a comment describing how it\u2019s affecting your installation. This will allow us to prioritize bugs based on how many users are affected. If you haven\u2019t found an existing issue that describes your suspected bug, Do not file an issue until you have received confirmation that it is in fact a bug. Invalid issues are very distracting and slow the pace at which ansible-cvp is developed. When submitting an issue, please be as descriptive as possible. Be sure to include: The environment in which ansible-cvp is running The exact steps that can be taken to reproduce the issue (if applicable) Any error messages generated Screenshots (if applicable) Please avoid prepending any sort of tag (e.g. \u201c[Bug]\u201d) to the issue title. The issue will be reviewed by a moderator after submission and the appropriate labels will be applied for categorization. Keep in mind that we prioritize bugs based on their severity and how much work is required to resolve them. It may take some time for someone to address your issue. Feature Requests # First, check the GitHub issues list to see if the feature you\u2019re requesting is already listed. (Be sure to search closed issues as well, since some feature requests have been rejected.) If the feature you\u2019d like to see has already been requested and is open, click \u201cadd a reaction\u201d in the top right corner of the issue and add a thumbs up (+1). This ensures that the issue has a better chance of receiving attention. Also feel free to add a comment with any additional justification for the feature. (However, note that comments with no substance other than a \u201c+1\u201d will be deleted. Please use GitHub\u2019s reactions feature to indicate your support.) Before filing a new feature request, consider raising your idea on the mailing list first. Feedback you receive there will help validate and shape the proposed feature before filing a formal issue. Good feature requests are very narrowly defined. Be sure to thoroughly describe the functionality and data model(s) being proposed. The more effort you put into writing a feature request, the better its chance is of being implemented. Overly broad feature requests will be closed. When submitting a feature request on GitHub, be sure to include the following: A detailed description of the proposed functionality A use case for the feature; who would use it and what value it would add to ansible-cvp A rough description of changes necessary Any third-party libraries or other resources which would be involved Please avoid prepending any sort of tag (e.g. \u201c[Feature]\u201d) to the issue title. The issue will be reviewed by a moderator after submission and the appropriate labels will be applied for categorization.

When suggesting a new feature, also make sure it won\u2019t conflict with any work that\u2019s already in progress. Any pull request which does not relate to an accepted issue will be closed.
